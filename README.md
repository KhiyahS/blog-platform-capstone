1. Project Setup
If not already done, finalize the React setup (or Preact + TypeScript) with routing and basic configuration.

2. Authentication Flow
Add a Protected Route to ensure that users can only access certain pages (like creating posts) when logged in.

Create a logout feature to allow users to log out and clear their session.

3. Post List & Details
Post List Page (HomePage) has been created, but you may want to:

Add pagination or infinite scrolling for post lists.

Display more details for each post by linking to a Post Details page (using routes).

Implement a filtering/search feature for the posts.

4. Post Details Page
Create a Post Detail page to view the full content of a post when clicked.

Include the Comment Section on this page to allow users to comment on individual posts.

5. Comment Section
CommentForm: Allow users to add comments to posts.

CommentDisplay: Display the list of comments for each post. You may want to structure the comments with nested replies.

6. State Management
Global State Management using React Context API for authentication (and possibly post/task state) to share the user info and posts across components.

Handling API state like loading, success, and error messages globally for all components.

7. UI Components
You might want to create reusable UI components like buttons, modals, forms, and error/success alerts.

Add a Navbar with links to Home, Create Post, Login, etc.

8. Styling & Responsiveness
Finalize styling using TailwindCSS to ensure that the app is responsive and looks polished across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Test on different screen sizes and refine the layout.

9. Error Handling
Add error handling for failed API requests (e.g., posts, login, comments). This includes displaying loading states and error messages in the UI.

10. Testing
Test the entire frontend flow (authentication, post creation, commenting) to ensure it works smoothly.

Unit testing for key components like the LoginForm, PostForm, and PostList using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

11. Deployment
Once everything is complete, deploy the frontend to Render (or Netlify, Vercel) as a static site.

Rough Estimation of Work Left:
Frontend Routing (Protected Routes, Navigation, Post Details) – 3-4 hours

Comment Section (Form + Display) – 2-3 hours

State Management (Context API for Authentication) – 2 hours

UI Components & Responsiveness – 2-3 hours

Final Testing & Deployment – 2-3 hours

Frontend (frontend/)
This folder contains your React frontend code.

public/: Contains static files like index.html and images. React will use this as the entry point for rendering.

src/: Contains all the React code and logic.

components/: Holds all the reusable components like Header, PostList, PostForm, and forms for login and register.

services/: Contains the logic to interact with the backend API. You'll have methods to send data (e.g., creating posts, registering users, etc.).

context/: Used for managing global state using React Context API (e.g., authentication state).

App.js: The main component that renders all other components.

index.js: The entry point for the React app where the root component (App) is rendered.

styles/: Contains the CSS styles or if you use a framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap, you could configure it here.
