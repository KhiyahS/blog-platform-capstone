Frontend Development Plan
Choose a Frontend Framework:
Depending on your preference, you can use any of the following frontend frameworks:

React.js (recommended for dynamic and scalable web apps).

Vue.js (great for quick setups and progressive enhancement).

Angular (if you're working on large enterprise-grade applications).

Set Up Your Frontend Development Environment:
If you decide to use React, you can quickly create a React app using Create React App.
Frontend Development: You can begin working on the frontend (React, Vue, etc.)

Mocking API Requests: If your backend isn't ready yet, you can mock API requests or use the local backend during development.

Deployment: Once you're happy with the frontend, deploy it to a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

Frontend (frontend/)
This folder contains your React frontend code.

public/: Contains static files like index.html and images. React will use this as the entry point for rendering.

src/: Contains all the React code and logic.

components/: Holds all the reusable components like Header, PostList, PostForm, and forms for login and register.

services/: Contains the logic to interact with the backend API. You'll have methods to send data (e.g., creating posts, registering users, etc.).

context/: Used for managing global state using React Context API (e.g., authentication state).

App.js: The main component that renders all other components.

index.js: The entry point for the React app where the root component (App) is rendered.

styles/: Contains the CSS styles or if you use a framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap, you could configure it here.
